# SHA-encryption-method
This algorithm encrypts plaintext in 5 methods all implemented in a menu driven program and also supports file encoding<br />
Secure Hash Algorithms, also known as SHA, are a family of cryptographic functions designed to keep data secured.<br />
It works by transforming the data using a hash function: an algorithm that consists of bitwise operations, modular addition.<br />
The hash function then produces a fixed-size string that looks nothing like the original.<br />
Here there are 5 methods used : sha1, sha224, sha256, sha384 & sha512
